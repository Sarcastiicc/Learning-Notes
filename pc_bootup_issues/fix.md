# Background
As I've installed dual system on my PC's 2 different drives, sometimes I have to change the boot order in the BIOS. 
Strange thing is that sometimes the system cannot boot to OS with the yellow indicator on the motherboard is on.

# Steps to fix
1. Turn on the system.
    The yellow indicator is on and monitor stays as black screen.
2. Short the 2 pins marked as CLRTC on the motherboard.
    You're gonna see the system reboot after doing this. 
3. Go to BIOS this time to select the Windows drive to boot.
    You will successfully boot to Windows.
4. Once you reboot again, you will see the black screen again with the yellow indicator on, Be patient this time, leave it alone, as it shall take more time to boot up.
5. After this process, you will be able to reboot smoothly without any trouble.
