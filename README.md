# Taking Notes with Github

## The reason why I chose Github
This is my first time trying taking notes with Github.
I used to take notes with Notion, Confluence or some other Notes apps. 
But I found that it was quite hard for me to track back a particular line.
I would like to know the accurate time that I wrote this done and what I was thinking at that time.
Fortunately I came up with this idea. I'm able to achieve my goal with Git and Github commit log.
That is awesome.

## Future plan
I'm gonna migrate most of my notes here from other note apps.
